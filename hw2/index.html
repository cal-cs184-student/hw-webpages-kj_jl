		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In this assignment we will first explore and implement de Casteljau's algorithm for computing Bezier Curves and Surfaces where we coded out each evaluation step along the way. Then we move onto navigating through meshes via halfedge data structure and implementing the local mesh operations (flip and split) as well as global mesh operations such as upsampling via loop subdivision algorithm. Those algorithms and operations not only allowed us to define a smooth surface/shape, but also enabled us to smooth out corners and edges to make the 3D meshes super cool!
		<br><br>
		Before working on this project, we didn't know that during edge flips we need to somehow rotate the inner halfedges or change the orientation of the left-right triangles into top-down. We thought we only needed to change the orientation of the middle edge that we are flipping. So this is something interesting to learn. In addition to that, it's interesting and fascinating to see how just by computing the weighted average of normals at vertices we are able to go from flat shading with distinct edges to phong shading with a very smooth surface. It's so simple yet very powerful!

		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		<p>
			<span style="color: blue;"> 1) Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.</span><br>
  			<span style="color: black;"> De Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive method used to evaluate Bezier curves. It works by linearly interpolating between control points at a given parameter t. The process continues recursively until only a single point remains, which is the point on the Bezier curve corresponding to parameter t. At each recursive step, we will compute n-1 intermediate points if given n points for input. In our implementation, we perform one step of the de Casteljau's algorithm by iterating through the input points, and computing the "weighted" average of two consecutive points repeatedly according to the lerp function: lerp(p<sub>i</sub>+p<sub>i+1</sub>, t) = (1-t)p<sub>i</sub>+tp<sub>i+1</sub> and then storing those final results into an array of Vector2D and then returning it.</span>
			<br><br>
			<span style="color: blue;"> 2) Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control points of your choosing. Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below. </span><br>
			<span style="color: blue;"> Show screenshots of each step / level of the evaluation from the original control points down to the final evaluated point. Press E to step through. Toggle C to show the completed Bezier curve as well. </span><br>

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		<p>
			<span style="color: blue;"> 1) Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.</span><br>
  			<span style="color: black;"> A Bezier surface is an extension of a Bezier curve into two dimensions where instead of a 1D parameter t, we now have two parameters u and v. We can also think of the Bezier surface as being formed by a collection of Bezier curves. For each Bezier curve we are given in the 3D space, we first use parameter u to find the final points of all of those curves using an algorithm that's similar to what we did in part 1 (the only difference is going from 2D points to 3D points). Then we connect those final points to form a new curve, which we then apply de Casteljau again to find the final point that lies on the Bezier surface. In general, for an nxm Bezier surface, the control points are arranged in a grid, and the evaluation consists of two steps: 1) Apply De Casteljau's algorithm along one parameter u to get a set of intermediate points. 2) Apply De Casteljau's algorithm again along the other parameters v to get the final surface point.
				<br><br>
				In our implementation, we first call BezierPatch::evaluate where we break up the control points into rows, then pass them into evaluate1D (evaluate1D internally calls evaluateStep to perform one step of de Casteljau) to compute the control points for the final curve. Then those control points are collected back in evaluate to compute the final point on the surface using evaluate1D applied on v again.

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		<p>
			<span style="color: blue;"> 1) Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.</span><br>
  			<span style="color: black;"> In our implementation, to compute the area-weighted vertex normal we use the halfedge data structure to iterate through all faces that are incident to the current vertex. We also initialized two variables to keep track of total normal and total area (for normalizing in the last step). In order to compute the face normals, we need to first grab the positions of the two other vertices forming the triangle with our current vertex. Then we do vector subtraction to get two vectors that lie on that face. We then use cross product to compute the vector that is perpendicular to both vectors (i.e. the normal). In the meantime, we use 1/2 * normal to compute the area of that face as well and add it into the total area. We also store area * normal into our total normal (multiplied by area to account for the weighted average later on). Then we begin to iterate to the next face. Finally, after all faces are traversed through, we divide our total normal by total area (for weighted average since area/total_area gives us the weight). And lastly, we normalize the final normal and return it.</span>

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
		<p>
			<span style="color: blue;"> 1) Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.</span><br>
  			<span style="color: black;"> To implement the edge flip, we first drew out a detailed diagram for both before and after flip involving all vertices, edges, faces and halfedges. In code, we first retrieve all of the necessary information. Then we begin to reassign the pointers for all of the existing vertices, edges, faces and halfedges according to the after flip diagram. This includes updating the halfedges for vertices, edges and faces while setting neighbors for halfedges both internal and external. Luckily we are able to achieve the correct result after some very careful follow through with the diagram so we didn't have to do any extensive debugging.</span>

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
		<p>
			<span style="color: blue;"> 1) Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.</span><br>
  			<span style="color: black;"> To implement edge split, we basically went through a similar process to part 4 where we drew out the before and after diagrams for performing the split and labelled out all of the information we need to consider and add. For edge split, we again first retrieve all of the vertices, halfedges etc. Then we compute the midpoint between the two ends of the edge we are splitting on. After that, we need to create one new vertex (the midpoint), two new faces, three new edges and 6 new halfedges for finishing up the split. We assigned all of the new vertices and edges' isNew property to true. Then we begin to reassign all of the pointers for all vertices, edges, faces and halfedges, similar to what we did in part 4 (except this time there is more reassignments). After all reassignment is done, we simply return the new vertex (midpoint).</span>

			</div>
			<br><br>
			<span style="color: blue;"> 4) Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.</span><br>
  			<span style="color: black;"> We at first forgot to set the newly created edges's isNew property to true. And at that time when we were eyeballing the splits and everything looked like it was working properly so we just moved on. It wasn't until we were having trouble with part 6 that we realized we probably missed some details in this part (created some really weird shape after loop division, and that's when we realized the splitting doesn't look quite right). Then we came back to part 5 to see what details we might be missing and realized that we forgot to set the isNew properties (which took a while to figure out).</span>
			<br><br>
		</p>

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		<p>
			<span style="color: blue;"> 1) Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.</span><br>
  			<span style="color: black;"> We basically followed the recommended guidelines and the comments in starter code. In our implementation, we begin by pre-computing the positions for all vertices in the original mesh using the loop subdivision rule (here we traverse over all neighboring vertices of the current one and compute the weighted average) and storing their new positions inside their respective newPosition property (saved for later). Next, we compute the positions for all of the new vertices (which are essentially midpoints of all edges in the original mesh) and store those new positions into edge's newPosition property. In the meantime, we also set the isNew property of all of those edges to false since they come from the original mesh. Then we begin to do all of the actual splitting by iterating over all old edges and calling our part5's splitEdge on each of them which creates a new vertex who will take the edge's newPosition and the isNew property of the vertex will also be set to true. After that, we need to flip any new edge that connects an old and a new vertex by calling our part4's flipEdge on it. Finally, in our last step we reassign the positions for all of the old vertices (assign them to the newPosition) and set all new vertices' isNew property to false.</span>
			<br><br>
			<span style="color: blue;"> 2) Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?</span><br>
  			<span style="color: black;"> As we do more iterations of loop subdivision, the sharp corners and edges begin to flatten out/smooth out more and more. And this is because loop subdivision updates the new positions of vertices in a way such that it maintains the original shape while ensuring continuity and fairness (weighted contributions from the neighbors, &frac38; - &frac18; rule preserves edge fairness) within the mesh. This ensures that the mesh can converge smoothly to a continuous limit surface. This rounding/smoothing effect is obvious from the screenshots below where we can see going from the 0 iteration of loop subdivision up to 4 iterations of subdivision, the cube begins to become more and more rounded and ball-like. The contrast is especially noticeable going from 0 iteration to 1 iteration of subdivision where we can see all of the eight sharp corners of the cube just "magically" disappear and become a lot more rounded than before (couldn't even tell which vertices used to be the corners).</span>
			<br><br>
			<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
				<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
				  <tr>
					<td style="text-align: center;">
					  <img src="images/part6_smooth_0.png" width="400px"/>

					</td>
				  </tr>

					  <figcaption>Cube at iteration 4.</figcaption>
					</td>
				  </tr>
				</table>
			</div>
			<br>
			<span style="color: black;"> To reduce this smoothing effect, we can pre-process the cube by pre-splitting edges around the cube like in the following image. And we can see now when we do 1 iteration of subdivision, the corners are still pretty obvious from the image (it still retains the cube-like shape compared to the ball-like shape from above). Even after 3 rounds of subdivision, it still maintains the cube-shape (which looks like a dice at this point).</span>
			<br><br>
			<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
				<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

				  </tr>
				</table>
			</div>
			<br><br>
			<span style="color: blue;"> 3) Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.</span><br>
  			<span style="color: black;"> We can pre-process the cube by splitting the diagonal on each face of the cube so that now we will have two symmetrical diagonals on each face. Then when we subdivide it, we can see that it now can be subdivided symmetrically as hoped.<br><br>
				The original asymmetric subdivision occurs because the starting topology of the cube is itself asymmetrical along all 3 axes due to the single diagonal on each face (i.e. they are not left-right nor top-down symmetric). The initial triangulation is not consistent across all faces of the cube. Therefore when we perform subdivision, we will not get symmetrical results. <br><br>
				By splitting the diagonal on each face, we now end up with a cross-like shape, which is symmetrical, on each face as seen in the image below. Since each face is now completely identical and symmetrical with even triangulation, when we do subdivisions it will also produce symmetrical results.
